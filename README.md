# Simulations of transport properties of a nanowire in a magnetic field

This repository contains code for performing simulations of an InAs nanowire using the kwant package. It is a continuation of the work done in <https://github.com/dk1713/Nanowire>.

## Setup

``` bash
 # Install
 git clone https://github.com/mikeyh30/nanowire-simulation.git
 cd nanowire-simulation
 pip install .
```

Change the path to the scratch folder in ```globals.yml``` to point to the scratch folder.
